# FMCW_Radar_IM  
The code about deep-learning based FMCW Radar interference mitigation.  
beatInterfer_FMCW.m generates the beat signals of the interferences between FMCW radars.  
beatSig_FMCW.m generates the beat signals of the target echo signals.  
beatSig_FMCW_mov.m generates the beat signals of echo signals of the moving targets.  
main.m is the main function used to generate the interfered radar signals.
